## The Developer Story

**Who built this:**  
A KPPS parent (also a developer and researcher in mathematics, consciousness, and systems design) working with their child (a KPPS student).

**Why it was built:**  
To give Kingsley Park a tool that embodies the school's values — not retrofitted corporate edtech, but something **designed from the ground up** for KPPS culture.

**What makes it different:**  
Most classroom tech is built for scale and monetisation. This is built for **one school first** — to prove that privacy-by-design, calm interaction, and genuine systems thinking are possible without sacrificing engagement.

**The offer:**  
This package is a **gift**. No licensing fees. No vendor lock-in. No hidden agenda. Just: "Here's something I made for our school. Let's see if it works. If it doesn't, we learn. If it does, we tell the story together."

---

## Contact & Iteration

**For technical questions:**  
[Developer contact — email / phone]

**For pilot coordination:**  
[KPPS teacher contact or Principal]

**For feedback:**  
This is a **living prototype**. What works, what confuses students, what lands with parents, what makes teaching easier (or harder) — all of that shapes the next version.

---

## The Veil (Reprise)

**What students see:**  
A companion with four vitals and 15 emotional states. Daily care routines. Gentle interactions.

**What students learn:**  
Homeostasis. Feedback loops. Cause and effect. Emotional regulation. Data literacy. Resilience.

**The veil is the interface** between visible mechanics and invisible principles. It makes abstract concepts **tangible** without reducing them to trivia.

That's what makes this STEM.  
That's what makes it wellbeing.  
That's what makes it **KPPS**.

**Built with a KPPS kid.**  
**Designed for the KPPS way.**

Faster than lightning.  
Slower than moss.
