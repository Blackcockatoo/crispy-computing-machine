# Meta-Pet & The Veil — Teacher Hub
## Welcome to the Kingsley Park Implementation Package

**Built with your student. Designed for your school. Ready to deploy.**

---

### What this package is

This is a **complete classroom implementation system** for Jewble, the privacy-first Meta-Pet co-created with a KPPS student (my son) specifically for Kingsley Park's wellbeing and STEM programs.

You're receiving:
- **7 structured sessions** (piloted, scripted, aligned to KPPS teaching model)
- **Student reflection tools** that work with your existing wellbeing language
- **Parent communication** ready to paste into Sentral
- **Technical/privacy documentation** for leadership sign-off
- **Values integration maps** showing how this fits your strategic plan

This isn't a vendor pitch. It's a **working prototype built for KPPS**, offered as partnership rather than product.

### Why "The Veil"?

In systems thinking, **the veil** is the interface between visible mechanics and invisible principles.

**Students see:** a companion with four vitals, 15 emotional states, daily care routines.

**Students learn:** cause → effect sequencing, emotional regulation, responsibility without punishment, homeostasis, genetic variation, system repair.

The veil makes **abstract concepts tangible** without dumbing them down. That's what makes it STEM. That's what makes it safe for wellbeing work.

### How this fits "The Kingsley Way"

**Your mission:** happy, safe, inspiring learning in an ever-changing world.

**Your values:** Respect, Resilience, Excellence, Cooperation, Community.

**Your teaching model:** Gradual Release (I do / We do / You do) + explicit instruction.

**Jewble's design:** offline-first privacy architecture + calm "meditation mechanics" + observable emotional systems + reflection-before-action loops.

This package shows you **exactly where they connect** — and gives you the scripts to make it work in a classroom tomorrow.

### The pilot proposal (2 weeks, 7 sessions, one class)

**Week 1 (Sessions 1–4):** Onboarding → wellbeing routines → values language → reflection practice

**Week 2 (Sessions 5–7):** STEM lens (homeostasis + data) → student showcase → teacher debrief

**Outcome:** engagement data + wellbeing language evidence + a clear digital safety story you can report to leadership.

**Teacher load:** ~20 minutes per session. No new accounts to manage. No data to export. No parent opt-in complexity (offline-first = structurally safe).

---

### Who this is for (at KPPS)

**Primary audience:** classroom teachers (Prep–Year 6 range, but optimised for Years 3–6)

**Strategic stakeholders:** Principal, Assistant Principal (Wellbeing), ICT Coordinator, School Council

**Parent community:** families who care about digital safety + screen time quality + STEM literacy

### What happens next

1. **Read the Implementation Guide** (7-session structure)
2. **Review the Facilitation Scripts** (exact language for each session)
3. **Check the Values Integration Map** (for leadership conversations)
4. **Send the Parent Communication** (if you decide to pilot)

Or just **start with Session 1** and see what happens.

The system is designed to feel calm, not complicated. If it doesn't feel that way in practice, that's signal for me to refine it further.

---

### Contact & iteration

This is a **living prototype**, not a locked product.

**Feedback loop:** what worked, what confused students, what landed with parents, what made your job easier (or harder).

**Technical support:** I'm the developer. If something breaks or needs adjustment, I fix it.

**Philosophy:** tools should serve teachers, not create new compliance burdens. If this adds friction instead of reducing it, we redesign.

---

### The underlying commitment

Kingsley Park already runs a **wellbeing-first culture**. You already teach **systems thinking** in STEM. You already use **explicit instruction** effectively.

This package doesn't ask you to change your approach. It gives you **one more tool** that works *within* what you already do well — and keeps student privacy and digital safety as the architectural default.

Built with a KPPS kid.  
Shaped by the KPPS way.  
Offered as partnership.

Ready when you are.
