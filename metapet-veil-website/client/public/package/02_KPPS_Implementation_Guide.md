# 7-Session Implementation Guide
## Meta-Pet Pilot for KPPS Classrooms

**Duration:** 2 weeks (7 × 20-minute sessions)  
**Teaching model:** Gradual Release (I do / We do / You do)  
**Focus areas:** Wellbeing routines → Values language → STEM thinking

---

## Session 1: Onboarding + Values Framing
**Learning Intention:** Students understand the Meta-Pet as a "living system" and connect care routines to KPPS values.

### Structure (20 min)

**I Do (5 min)** — Teacher models first interaction
- Display Meta-Pet on screen (or individual devices)
- Narrate one complete care loop: "I'm checking the four vitals — Nutrition, Hydration, Rest, Stimulation. My pet's mood is Calm because all vitals are balanced. That's homeostasis."
- Demonstrate ONE action: "I'll feed it. Watch what happens to Nutrition... and watch the mood."
- **Values link:** "This is about Respect — gentle, thoughtful interaction. Not random button-mashing."

**We Do (10 min)** — Guided practice
- Students open their Meta-Pet (individual devices or pairs)
- Teacher circulates: "What's your pet's current mood? Which vital is lowest? What action makes sense?"
- Whole-class check-in: "Hands up if your pet's mood changed after one action. What did you notice?"
- **Values link:** "We're practising Responsibility — observing before acting."

**You Do (5 min)** — Independent reflection
- Students complete ONE care cycle independently
- Quick written prompt: "My pet's mood was ___. I chose to ___. The mood became ___."
- Exit ticket: "One thing I noticed about cause and effect."

### Teacher notes
- Don't explain the full genome system yet — keep it observable, not abstract
- If students ask "what's the best action?", redirect: "What does your pet's state tell you?"
- Mood changes should feel logical, not random — flag any confusion for developer feedback

---

## Session 2: First Full Care Loop + Observation Practice
**Learning Intention:** Students learn the four-vital framework and begin pattern recognition.

### Structure (20 min)

**I Do (5 min)** — Teacher models complete vital scan
- "I'm going to check all four vitals systematically: Nutrition first, then Hydration, Rest, Stimulation."
- Show how vitals interact: "If Rest is low, the pet might not respond well to high Stimulation. Systems balance."
- **Values link:** "This is Excellence — not rushing, being thorough."

**We Do (10 min)** — Paired observation
- Students work in pairs: one operates, one records observations
- Task: "Complete three care actions. Record which vital changed and what happened to mood."
- Teacher models observation language: "I fed it twice. Nutrition went up, but mood stayed Anxious. Why? Let's check Rest..."
- **Values link:** "Cooperation — helping each other see what we might miss alone."

**You Do (5 min)** — Solo goal-setting
- Each student sets a small goal: "Keep mood stable" OR "Bring one vital back to green"
- Record outcome: "I achieved / didn't achieve my goal because ___."

### Teacher notes
- Introduce the idea that "optimal care" isn't just maxing all vitals — it's reading the system
- Celebrate students who notice patterns ("I saw that Anxious means it needs Rest more than Food")
- If students get frustrated with "wrong" actions, reframe: "That's data. What did you learn?"

## Session 3: Reflection Practice + Emotional State Awareness
**Learning Intention:** Students connect pet emotions to their own self-regulation strategies.

### Structure (20 min)

**I Do (5 min)** — Teacher models emotional state identification
- Display pet in specific mood (e.g., Overwhelmed, Content, Restless)
- Think-aloud: "My pet is Overwhelmed. In my life, when I feel overwhelmed, I need... Rest? Space? Let's see if the pet system works the same way."
- Demonstrate reflection prompt: "What helps when you feel ___?"
- **Values link:** "Resilience — recognising feelings and choosing recovery strategies."

**We Do (10 min)** — Class emotional state mapping
- Create class chart: "What moods has your Meta-Pet shown?"
- Students call out states, teacher records (Calm, Anxious, Joyful, Melancholy, etc.)
- Pair-share: "Pick one mood. What action helped your pet move out of that state?"
- **Values link:** "Community — we learn from each other's observations."

**You Do (5 min)** — Personal reflection
- Written prompt: "When my pet feels ___, I try ___. When I feel ___, I could try ___."
- Optional share-out (no pressure)

### Teacher notes
- Keep language gentle — this isn't therapy, it's systems observation
- Some students will resist the self-reflection link; that's fine, keep it optional
- If a student shares something concerning, follow usual wellbeing protocols (don't spotlight in class)

---

## Session 4: Responsibility + Repair Sequences
**Learning Intention:** Students practice "consequence without punishment" — if vitals drop, recovery is a skill, not a failure.

### Structure (20 min)

**I Do (5 min)** — Teacher models a "repair sequence"
- Deliberately let one vital drop to red: "I've been busy with other things and forgot to check my pet. Now Rest is critical and mood is Exhausted."
- Narrate recovery: "This isn't punishment. It's cause and effect. I'll focus on Rest first, then rebalance the others. Watch the mood shift as the system stabilises."
- **Values link:** "Respect + Resilience — repair without blame."

**We Do (10 min)** — Guided repair challenge
- Students intentionally let one vital drop (controlled scenario)
- Task: "Bring your pet back to Calm or Content using the fewest actions possible."
- Class discussion: "What order did you do actions in? Why?"
- **Values link:** "Cooperation — troubleshooting together."

**You Do (5 min)** — Reflection on bounce-back
- Prompt: "If something goes wrong with my Meta-Pet, I can ___."
- Connect to real life (optional): "If I make a mistake at school, I can ___."

### Teacher notes
- Frame "letting vitals drop" as a learning experiment, not neglect
- Emphasise sequencing: "If everything is low, what order helps most?"
- Some students will find this stressful — offer choice to observe instead of participate

## Session 5: STEM Lens — Homeostasis as System
**Learning Intention:** Students identify the Meta-Pet as a self-regulating system and use STEM vocabulary (homeostasis, inputs, outputs, feedback loops).

### Structure (20 min)

**I Do (5 min)** — Teacher introduces homeostasis concept
- "The Meta-Pet is like your body — it tries to stay balanced. That's called homeostasis."
- Show diagram: Input (action) → System (vitals + mood) → Output (behaviour/state)
- Model one feedback loop: "I gave Stimulation. The pet became Joyful. That 'told' me it needed more play. That's a feedback signal."
- **STEM link:** explicitly name this as "systems thinking" in the curriculum

**We Do (10 min)** — Class data collection
- Create class chart: "Let's map cause and effect."
- Students call out: "I did ___ → vital ___ changed → mood became ___."
- Teacher records patterns: "So multiple people noticed that Rest + Hydration → Calm. Why might that be?"
- Introduce genetics briefly: "Each pet's DNA is slightly different, so patterns won't be identical."

**You Do (5 min)** — Individual hypothesis
- Prompt: "If I want my pet to feel ___, I predict I need to focus on ___ vital(s)."
- Test it next session — record whether hypothesis was accurate

### Teacher notes
- This is where STEM vocabulary becomes explicit — use it confidently
- Don't over-explain genetics yet; just acknowledge variation
- Frame this as "science in action" — observation, prediction, testing

---

## Session 6: STEM Lens — Data + Pattern Recognition
**Learning Intention:** Students analyse their own interaction data and identify patterns in system behaviour.

### Structure (20 min)

**I Do (5 min)** — Teacher models data analysis
- Review class chart from Session 5
- Highlight patterns: "We saw that Nutrition alone doesn't fix Melancholy — it needs Rest too. That's multi-variable thinking."
- Introduce simple data language: "If we track actions over time, we see trends, not just random events."

**We Do (10 min)** — Student data review
- Students review their own reflection notes from Sessions 1–5
- Pair task: "Find one pattern in your care actions. What worked consistently?"
- Class share: "What patterns did you notice in your Meta-Pet's system?"
- **STEM link:** "This is data literacy — making predictions from evidence."

**You Do (5 min)** — System summary
- Prompt: "My Meta-Pet's system works like this: ___."
- Optional diagram: students draw their own Input → System → Output map

### Teacher notes
- Celebrate students who notice genetic variation: "My friend's pet responds differently to the same action — that's DNA."
- This session sets up the showcase (Session 7) — students should start thinking about what they'll explain
- Keep data language simple: trends, patterns, cause-effect, not statistical complexity

---

## Session 7: Student Showcase + Metacognition
**Learning Intention:** Students articulate what they learned about systems, wellbeing, and their own thinking.

### Structure (20 min)

**Student Presentations (15 min)**
- Each student (or pair) shares briefly (1–2 min):
  - "One thing I learned about my Meta-Pet's system."
  - "One thing I learned about myself."
- Teacher facilitates, doesn't evaluate
- Optional: students demo one care sequence and explain their reasoning
- **Values link:** "Community + Excellence — showing our learning journey."

**Teacher-Led Reflection (5 min)**
- Class discussion:
  - "What made this different from other classroom tech?"
  - "Did the offline-first design feel safer? Why?"
  - "Would you want to continue using this? Why/why not?"
- Collect anonymous feedback (thumbs up/sideways/down or brief written response)

### Teacher notes
- This is your data collection moment for leadership reporting
- Note: engagement level, quality of systems language, wellbeing vocabulary use
- Ask students explicitly about privacy/safety feelings — this informs parent comms

---

## Post-Pilot: Teacher Debrief Prompts

**For leadership report:**
- Engagement: Did students want to return without timers/notifications?
- Wellbeing language: Could students name state → cause → repair?
- STEM thinking: Did students use systems vocabulary accurately?
- Digital safety: Did the offline-first design reduce usual tech-friction?

**For developer (me):**
- What confused students?
- What delighted students?
- What made your job harder?
- What would you change about the session structure?
