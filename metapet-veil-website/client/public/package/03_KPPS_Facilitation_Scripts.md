## Exact Language for Each Meta-Pet Session

**Use these scripts verbatim or adapt to your voice**  
**Values language is bolded for emphasis**

---

## Session 1: Onboarding + Values Framing

### Opening Hook (1 min)
"Today we're meeting a new kind of classroom companion. It's not a game — it's a **system**. That means it follows rules, like nature does. Our job is to observe those rules and learn how the system works. This connects to our KPPS value of **Respect** — we approach new things gently and thoughtfully."

### I Do Phase (5 min)

**Screen share / model on device:**

"I'm looking at my Meta-Pet. I can see four vitals here: Nutrition, Hydration, Rest, and Stimulation. Right now, my pet's mood is **Calm**. That's because the vitals are balanced — none of them are too high or too low. Scientists call this **homeostasis** — a system keeping itself stable.

Watch what happens when I choose one action. I'm going to feed my pet. [Execute action.] Now Nutrition has changed... and look, the mood shifted to **Content**. That's cause and effect. My action had a result.

Here's what I'm **not** doing: I'm not button-mashing. I'm not trying to 'win' anything. I'm observing, choosing carefully, and noticing what happens. That's **Respect** in action — for the system, and for my own thinking."

### We Do Phase (10 min)

**Students open individual Meta-Pets:**

"Okay, everyone open your Meta-Pet now. Don't do anything yet — just observe. 

Look at your four vitals. Which one is lowest? Don't tell me, just notice.

Now look at your pet's mood. What word describes it? [Pause.] 

Here's the question: **if you could only do one action right now, which would make the most sense?** Think about what the system is showing you.

[Circulate. Prompt individuals:] "What's your pet's mood? Which vital needs attention? What are you going to try?"

[After 2–3 minutes:] Hands up if your pet's mood changed after your action. What did you notice? [Take 3–4 responses. Affirm observations, don't correct.]

This is **Responsibility** — you're learning to read the system before you act, not just reacting randomly."

### You Do Phase (5 min)

**Independent practice:**

"Now you're going to complete one more care cycle on your own. Choose an action, observe the result, and then write down three things on your device or paper:

1. My pet's mood was ___.
2. I chose to ___.
3. The mood became ___.

When you're done, write one sentence: **One thing I noticed about cause and effect.**

[Circulate quietly. Don't interrupt student focus.]

### Closing (1 min)

"Tomorrow we'll go deeper into the four-vital framework and start looking for patterns. For now, you've done the hardest part — slowing down and observing. That's where good systems thinking starts."

---

## Session 2: First Full Care Loop + Observation Practice

### Opening Hook (1 min)
"Yesterday we learned that the Meta-Pet is a **system** — it responds to our actions in logical ways. Today we're going to practice **Excellence** — being thorough, not rushing. We'll scan all four vitals systematically and see how they interact."

### I Do Phase (5 min)

**Teacher models systematic vital scan:**

"I'm going to check all four vitals in order. Not random — in order. Watch.

Nutrition: green. Hydration: yellow. Rest: red. Stimulation: green.

Now, here's the systems-thinking question: **if I only fix one vital, will that solve the problem?** Let's test it. My pet's mood is **Anxious**. Rest is red, so I'll address that first. [Execute action.] 

Rest improved... but mood is still Anxious. Why? Because Hydration is still low. The system needs **balance**, not just one fix.

This is like your body — if you're tired AND thirsty, just sleeping won't make you feel great. You need both. Systems balance. That's **homeostasis** again."

### We Do Phase (10 min)

**Paired observation task:**

"You're working in pairs now. One person operates the Meta-Pet, one person records observations. You'll swap roles halfway.

Task: Complete **three care actions**. For each action, the recorder writes down:
- Which vital changed?
- What happened to the pet's mood?

Operators, narrate what you're doing: 'I'm feeding it because Nutrition is low.' Recorders, write exactly what you see happen.

[After 5 minutes:] Swap roles now.

[After full 10 minutes:] Let's hear some observations. What patterns did you notice? [Take 3–4 responses. Highlight connections between vitals and mood.]

This is **Cooperation** — you're helping each other see details you might miss alone."

### You Do Phase (5 min)

**Solo goal-setting:**

"Now, solo work. Set a small goal for your Meta-Pet. Either:
- Keep the mood stable (don't let it drop), OR
- Bring one vital back to green.

Work for 3 minutes, then write: **I achieved / didn't achieve my goal because ___.**

If you didn't achieve it, that's not failure — that's data. What did you learn about the system?"

### Closing (1 min)

"You're getting better at reading the system. Tomorrow we'll connect these moods to our own emotions and see what we can learn about ourselves."

---

## Session 3: Reflection Practice + Emotional State Awareness

### Opening Hook (1 min)
"The Meta-Pet shows 15 different emotional states — Calm, Anxious, Joyful, Melancholy, Overwhelmed, and more. Today we're exploring how these moods emerge from the vitals, and what that might teach us about our own feelings. This connects to **Resilience** — recognizing feelings and knowing how to recover."

### I Do Phase (5 min)

**Teacher models emotional state identification:**

"My pet is showing **Overwhelmed** right now. Let's think about what that means. When I feel overwhelmed in my life, what do I need? Usually... space. Quiet. Rest.

Let's test if the Meta-Pet system works the same way. Rest is low, so I'll try that. [Execute action.] Mood shifted to **Calm**. Interesting. The system responded to the same thing that helps humans.

Now, I'm going to use a reflection prompt: **What helps when you feel overwhelmed?** For me, it's taking a break, slowing down, maybe going outside. For the pet, it was Rest. Systems have patterns."

### We Do Phase (10 min)

**Class emotional state mapping:**

"Let's create a class chart. I want you to call out any moods you've seen your Meta-Pet show. I'll write them all down. [Record on board: Calm, Anxious, Joyful, Melancholy, Restless, Content, etc.]

Now, pair-share: Pick one mood from the board. What action helped your pet move **out of** that state? Turn to your partner and compare notes.

[After 3 minutes:] Let's hear some examples. [Take 3–4 responses. Affirm observations.]

This is **Community** — we learn from each other's observations, and we realize we're not alone in figuring things out."

### You Do Phase (5 min)

**Personal reflection (optional share):**

"Silent writing time. Complete these sentences however feels true for you:

- When my Meta-Pet feels ___, I try ___.
- When I feel ___, I could try ___.

If you want to share, you can. If you'd rather keep it private, that's fine too. This is about your own thinking, not performance."

[Give 4 minutes of silent writing. Invite 1–2 volunteers to share if comfortable.]

### Closing (1 min)

"Tomorrow we'll practice something called a **repair sequence** — what happens when vitals drop and we need to bring the system back to balance. It's not about punishment; it's about recovery. That's **Resilience** in action."

---

## Session 4: Responsibility + Repair Sequences

### Opening Hook (1 min)
"Sometimes we make mistakes. Sometimes we forget to check in. Sometimes things just go wrong. Today we're learning that **repair is a skill**, not a punishment. This connects to the KPPS idea of logical consequences — actions have effects, and we can learn how to fix them."

### I Do Phase (5 min)

**Teacher models intentional "neglect" + repair:**

"I'm going to do something on purpose: I'm going to ignore my Meta-Pet's needs for a bit. Watch what happens.

[Let one vital drop to red. Mood shifts to Exhausted or similar.]

Now Rest is critical, and the mood is **Exhausted**. This isn't punishment — it's cause and effect. The system responded to my inaction.

Here's the repair sequence: I'll focus on Rest first because it's the most urgent. [Execute action.] Mood improving... Now I'll check the other vitals and rebalance. [Execute 1–2 more actions.] System stabilizing.

**Repair without blame.** That's the key. The system doesn't 'hate' me — it just shows me what needs attention. I respond, and it recovers. That's **Respect** and **Resilience** together."

### We Do Phase (10 min)

**Guided repair challenge:**

"Your turn. Here's the challenge: Let **one** vital drop to yellow or red on purpose. Controlled scenario — you're in charge.

Then, bring your pet back to **Calm** or **Content** using the fewest actions possible.

As you work, think about **order**: If multiple vitals are low, which one do you address first? Why?

[After 7 minutes:] Class discussion — what order did you use? Did anyone find a really efficient repair sequence? [Take 3–4 responses. Highlight systems-thinking language.]

This is **Cooperation** — troubleshooting together, sharing strategies."

### You Do Phase (5 min)

**Reflection on bounce-back:**

"Write down:

If something goes wrong with my Meta-Pet, I can ___.

If you want to connect it to real life, you can also write: If I make a mistake at school, I can ___.

But that second part is optional. The main point is: **you're learning that recovery is possible, and it's a skill.**"

### Closing (1 min)

"Next session, we shift into STEM mode. We've been observing systems naturally — now we'll use science vocabulary to describe what we've been doing. You're already thinking like systems scientists; we're just going to name it."

---

## Session 5: STEM Lens — Homeostasis as System

### Opening Hook (1 min)
"We've been using the word **homeostasis** a few times. Today we're going to understand it properly. Homeostasis is how systems — like your body, like ecosystems, like the Meta-Pet — keep themselves balanced. This is core science curriculum, and you've been doing it already."

### I Do Phase (5 min)

**Teacher introduces systems diagram:**

"Here's how systems work. [Draw on board: Input → System → Output.]

**Input:** that's an action I take. Feed, hydrate, rest, stimulate.

**System:** that's the Meta-Pet's vitals and mood processing the input.

**Output:** that's the new mood or vital state I observe.

Let me show you a **feedback loop**. I give Stimulation. [Execute action.] Pet becomes **Joyful**. That joy is a signal — it's telling me the system wanted more play. That feedback helps me make the next decision.

This is systems thinking. You use it in science class when you study ecosystems. You use it in your own body when you notice you're thirsty and drink water. The Meta-Pet makes it **visible**."

### We Do Phase (10 min)

**Class data collection:**

"Let's map cause and effect together. Call out what you've noticed:

'I did ___ → vital ___ changed → mood became ___.'

[Record on board. Look for patterns.] 

Interesting — multiple people said Rest + Hydration leads to **Calm**. Why might that combo work?

[Take responses. Introduce genetics briefly:] Each Meta-Pet's DNA is slightly different, so you won't see **identical** patterns. But you'll see trends. That's data literacy — looking for what happens **most of the time**, not demanding perfection."

### You Do Phase (5 min)

**Individual hypothesis formation:**

"Science is about predicting, not guessing. Write down:

If I want my pet to feel ___, I predict I need to focus on ___ vital(s).

Next session, you'll test whether your hypothesis was right. That's the scientific method in action."

### Closing (1 min)

"You've been doing systems thinking this whole time — now you have the vocabulary for it. Tomorrow we'll analyse your own data and look for patterns. You're becoming systems scientists."

---

## Session 6: STEM Lens — Data + Pattern Recognition

### Opening Hook (1 min)
"Scientists don't just observe once — they collect data over time and look for **patterns**. Today you're going to review everything you've learned about your Meta-Pet and identify trends. This is **data literacy**, and it's a key STEM skill."

### I Do Phase (5 min)

**Teacher models data analysis:**

"Let's look at our class chart from last session. [Review board notes.]

Pattern 1: Nutrition alone doesn't fix **Melancholy** — it needs Rest too. That's **multi-variable thinking**.

Pattern 2: **Anxious** usually means either Rest or Hydration is low — rarely both at once. That's a diagnostic pattern.

When we track actions over time, we see **trends**, not random events. That's the difference between anecdote and data."

### We Do Phase (10 min)

**Student data review (pairs):**

"Look back at your reflection notes from Sessions 1–5. Find **one pattern** in your Meta-Pet's behaviour. What worked consistently?

Pair task: Share your pattern with your partner. See if their Meta-Pet showed the same trend or something different.

[After 5 minutes:] Class share — what patterns did you notice? [Take 3–4 responses. Celebrate genetic variation: 'That's DNA — slightly different response curves.']

This is **data literacy** — making predictions from evidence, not guessing randomly."

### You Do Phase (5 min)

**System summary:**

"Write or draw: **My Meta-Pet's system works like this: ___.**

If you want to draw it, use the Input → System → Output diagram we learned.

If you want to write it, describe the main patterns you've noticed."

### Closing (1 min)

"Next session is our showcase. You'll explain one thing you learned about the system and one thing you learned about yourself. You're ready — you've been building this knowledge for two weeks."

---

## Session 7: Student Showcase + Metacognition

### Opening Hook (1 min)
"Today you're the teachers. You're going to show what you've learned about systems, wellbeing, and your own thinking. This connects to **Excellence** and **Community** — sharing your personal best with others."

### Student Presentations (15 min)

**Teacher facilitation:**

"Each person gets 1–2 minutes. Share:
- One thing you learned about your Meta-Pet's **system**.
- One thing you learned about **yourself**.

You can demo a care sequence if you want, or just talk. No judgment — this is about learning, not performing.

Who wants to start? [Invite volunteers, then rotate through class.]

[As students present, affirm observations: 'That's systems thinking.' 'You noticed genetic variation.' 'That's homeostasis.']"

### Teacher-Led Reflection (5 min)

**Class discussion:**

"Let's debrief together. Three questions:

1. What made this different from other classroom tech you've used?

2. Did the offline-first design — no accounts, no tracking — feel safer to you? Why?

3. Would you want to keep using this? Why or why not?

[Take responses. Keep it conversational, not evaluative.]

One more thing: I'm going to ask for quick anonymous feedback. Thumbs up if this was valuable. Thumbs sideways if you're neutral. Thumbs down if it wasn't helpful. [Record mentally for leadership report.]"

### Closing (2 min)

"You've spent two weeks learning systems thinking, wellbeing language, and data literacy through one small Meta-Pet. You've practised **Respect, Resilience, Excellence, Cooperation, and Community** — the KPPS values we live by.

Whether we continue using this tool or not, you've built skills that transfer everywhere: observing before acting, recognising patterns, recovering from mistakes, thinking in systems.

Thank you for being curious, thoughtful learners."
