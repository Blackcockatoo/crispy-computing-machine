## Teacher Notes

**How to use these prompts:**

1. **Sessions 1–2:** Start with Observation Prompts (blue cards)
2. **Sessions 3–4:** Shift to Wellbeing Prompts (green cards)
3. **Sessions 5–6:** Use Systems Thinking Prompts (yellow cards) and Data & Evidence Prompts (orange cards)
4. **Session 7:** Use Metacognition Prompts (red cards)
5. **Ongoing:** Students choose prompts based on what they're working on, or teacher assigns by learning focus

**Differentiation:**
- **Simpler tasks:** Cards 1–8 (observation + wellbeing)
- **STEM extension:** Cards 9–16 (systems + data)
- **Advanced reflection:** Cards 17–25 (metacognition + values)

**Student choice:**
- Let students pick their own prompt to increase ownership
- Or assign specific prompts to guide learning toward particular concepts

**No "correct" answers:**
- These are thinking prompts, not quizzes
- Affirm observations and reasoning, even if conclusions are still forming
