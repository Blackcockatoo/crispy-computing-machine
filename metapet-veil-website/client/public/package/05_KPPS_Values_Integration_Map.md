# KPPS Values Integration Map
## Strategic Alignment: Meta-Pet to School Priorities

**For:** Principal, Assistant Principal (Wellbeing), School Council, ICT Coordinator  
**Purpose:** Show how Jewble Meta-Pet supports KPPS mission, values, curriculum, and policies

---

## 1. Mission Alignment

### KPPS Mission
*"To provide a happy, safe and inspiring learning environment that equips children for an ever changing world."* ([kingsleypark.vic.edu.au][1])

### How Meta-Pet Delivers This

| Mission Element | Meta-Pet Design Feature | Student Experience |
|---|---|---|
| **Happy** | Calm "meditation mechanics"; no timers, no FOMO, no punishment loops | Students report feeling relaxed, not stressed, during interactions |
| **Safe** | Offline-first architecture; no accounts; DNA never transmitted; anti-addiction safeguards | Parents and students trust the digital environment |
| **Inspiring** | Real complexity (15 emotional states, genetic variation) without chaos | Students engage with genuine systems thinking, not simplified "edutainment" |
| **Ever-changing world** | Systems literacy (homeostasis, feedback loops, data patterns) transferable to any domain | Students build adaptable thinking skills, not rote responses |

---

## 2. KPPS Values Integration

### Value 1: **Respect** ([kingsleypark.vic.edu.au][2])

**KPPS Definition:** Treating others, property, and the environment with care and consideration.

**Meta-Pet Mechanics:**
- Students must **observe before acting** (vitals check → mood assessment → action choice)
- No "winning" or "losing" — only **cause and effect**
- System responds to **thoughtful interaction**, not button-mashing
- Teacher facilitation uses language: "Respect the system by slowing down and noticing"

**Student Demonstration of Respect:**
- Choosing actions based on what the pet's **state** shows, not random impulses
- Repairing neglected vitals without blame or shame
- Pair work: helping classmates observe patterns they might miss

---

### Value 2: **Resilience** ([kingsleypark.vic.edu.au][2])

**KPPS Definition:** Bouncing back from challenges, persisting, and learning from mistakes.

**Meta-Pet Mechanics:**
- When vitals drop, students practice **repair sequences** (not punishment — recovery)
- Mood shifts are **reversible** — no permanent "failure" states
- Reflection prompts frame low states as **data** ("What did I learn?"), not defeat
- Genetic variation means some pets are "harder" to care for — that's a feature, not a bug (builds persistence)

**Student Demonstration of Resilience:**
- If mood drops to Melancholy or Exhausted, students identify **what needs attention** and execute recovery
- Students set goals ("keep mood stable"), test strategies, and **iterate** when goals aren't met
- Class discussions normalize challenge: "My pet's DNA makes it sensitive to Rest — I'm learning to prioritise that"

---

### Value 3: **Excellence (Personal Best)** ([kingsleypark.vic.edu.au][2])

**KPPS Definition:** Striving to do one's best in all areas.

**Meta-Pet Mechanics:**
- No **comparative leaderboards** — progress is individual
- Students set **their own goals** (Session 2 onwards): "I want to keep mood Calm for three cycles"
- Reflection prompts ask: "What am I proud of? What will I work on next?"
- STEM lens invites hypothesis-testing: "Can I predict which action will work best?"

**Student Demonstration of Excellence:**
- Self-selected challenges (e.g., efficient repair, minimal actions to restore balance)
- Data literacy: tracking patterns over time, refining strategies based on evidence
- Metacognition: "At first I didn't understand homeostasis; now I can explain it"

---

### Value 4: **Cooperation** ([kingsleypark.vic.edu.au][2])

**KPPS Definition:** Working together, helping others, and valuing teamwork.

**Meta-Pet Mechanics:**
- **Pair observation tasks** (one operates, one records; roles swap)
- Class data collection: students contribute observations to shared pattern maps
- Genetic variation creates **natural diversity** — students compare notes without competition
- Teacher facilitation: "What did your partner notice that you didn't?"

**Student Demonstration of Cooperation:**
- Sharing repair strategies: "I found that Rest + Hydration fixes Anxious for my pet"
- Peer troubleshooting: "My friend's pet responded differently — we figured out it's DNA variation"
- Collaborative pattern recognition: class charts show trends across multiple pets

---

### Value 5: **Community Involvement** ([kingsleypark.vic.edu.au][2])

**KPPS Definition:** Being an active, contributing member of the school and wider community.

**Meta-Pet Mechanics:**
- Student **showcase** (Session 7): each student contributes one learning to the class knowledge base
- Teacher "blessings" language (affirming observations publicly without comparative judgment)
- Class constellation moments: "We've all noticed that Calm requires balance — that's homeostasis"
- Pilot design creates **KPPS-specific story**: "This was built with a KPPS student for KPPS students"

**Student Demonstration of Community Involvement:**
- Sharing discoveries during whole-class discussions
- Contributing anonymous feedback to improve the tool for future KPPS students
- Optional: student-led demos for parents or other classes (advocacy for their learning)

---

## 3. Curriculum Framework Alignment

### KPPS Explicit Teaching Model: Gradual Release ("I Do / We Do / You Do")

**Meta-Pet Session Structure Mirrors This:**

| Teaching Phase | Meta-Pet Application | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **I Do** (Teacher models) | Teacher demonstrates one care loop, narrates thinking aloud, shows cause-effect | Session scripts provide exact language for modelling |
| **We Do** (Guided practice) | Students work in pairs or whole class with teacher circulating, prompting questions | Observation tasks, class data collection, guided reflection |
| **You Do** (Independent practice) | Students set individual goals, test hypotheses, complete reflection prompts solo | Written reflections, solo care cycles, hypothesis testing |

**High Impact Teaching Strategy Alignment:**

- **Explicit Teaching:** Clear learning intentions, modelled thinking, structured practice
- **Feedback:** Reflection prompts provide self-assessment opportunities; teacher circulates to affirm/redirect
- **Questioning:** Open-ended prompts ("What pattern did you notice?") rather than closed recall
- **Multiple Exposures:** Same concepts (homeostasis, cause-effect) revisited across 7 sessions with increasing complexity

---

### STEM Curriculum (Weekly STEM sessions at KPPS)

**Meta-Pet as STEM Content:**

| STEM Concept | Meta-Pet Mechanic | Student Learning |
|---|---|---|
| **Systems Thinking** | Four-vital framework where all parts interact | "Changing one vital affects the whole system" |
| **Homeostasis** | Pet maintains balance unless vitals drop too far | "Systems self-regulate to stay stable" |
| **Feedback Loops** | Mood signals inform next action choice | "Output becomes input for the next cycle" |
| **Genetic Variation** | Each pet's DNA creates unique response curves | "Same input → different output depending on genetics" |
| **Data Literacy** | Pattern recognition over time, hypothesis testing | "Trends matter more than single observations" |
| **Multi-Variable Analysis** | Mood emerges from interaction of all four vitals | "Complex outcomes have multiple causes" |

**Cross-Curricular Links:**
- **Science:** living systems, ecosystems, human body (all use homeostasis)
- **Mathematics:** data collection, pattern recognition, graphing (optional extension: students chart vital changes)
- **Digital Technologies:** algorithmic thinking (if-then logic), systems architecture (optional: discussing how DNA encodes rules)

## 4. Wellbeing Policy Alignment

### KPPS Wellbeing Framework
*"The happiness and safety of children is at the heart of the Student Wellbeing & Engagement Policy."* ([kingsleypark.vic.edu.au][5])

**Policy Priorities:**

1. **Prevention-focused behaviour support** (Continuum of Behaviour Support, school-wide positive framework)
2. **Logical consequences** (students understand cause-effect, not arbitrary punishment)
3. **Respectful relationships** (students accept responsibility, respect others)
4. **Inclusive environment** (all students can participate and succeed)

**How Meta-Pet Supports These:**

| Policy Priority | Meta-Pet Design | Classroom Application |
|---|---|---|
| **Prevention-focused** | Daily care routines teach **anticipation** (check vitals *before* crisis) | Students rehearse "check-in before acting" habits transferable to self-regulation |
| **Logical consequences** | Vitals drop → mood shifts (cause-effect, not punishment) | Teacher frames consequences: "The system shows you what happens when Rest is neglected — not to punish, but to teach" |
| **Respectful relationships** | Students practise **repair without blame** (Recovery sequences in Session 4) | Language: "If something goes wrong, we fix it. That's respect." |
| **Inclusive environment** | Offline-first = no account barriers; genetic variation = no "perfect" performance | All students can engage; success is learning, not leaderboard rank |

---

### Digital Safety & Responsible Use (KPPS ICT Policy)

**KPPS Commitment:** *"Safe, responsible, ethical use of devices and online tools."* ([kingsleypark.vic.edu.au][4])

**Meta-Pet Privacy Architecture:**

| Safety Feature | How It Works | Benefit to KPPS |
|---|---|---|
| **Offline-first core** | Pet functions fully without internet; no data transmission during normal use | Reduces exposure to network risks; works in low-connectivity environments |
| **No account requirement** | No logins, no passwords, no identity capture | Zero risk of credential leaks; no compliance overhead for ICT team |
| **DNA never transmitted** | Pet's genetic code (180-digit base-7 genome) stays on device | No central "profile" to breach; student data never leaves their device |
| **Anti-addiction safeguards** | No timers, no FOMO notifications, no streak systems; vitals pause when backgrounded | Supports healthy screen time boundaries; students can close app without anxiety |
| **Age-appropriate UX** | Calm palette (midnight blue, sun-gold), meditation mechanics, gentle pace | Designed for focus, not dopamine exploitation |

**Parent Trust:**
- Parents can inspect the app without logging in or creating accounts
- No in-app purchases, no ads, no third-party trackers
- Clear data story: "Your child's pet lives on their device. We never see it."

## 5. Strategic Fit: Why Now, Why KPPS

### KPPS Context (from Annual Implementation Plan & School Review)

**Current priorities:**
- Strengthening **student voice and agency**
- Building **positive behaviour frameworks** school-wide
- Enhancing **STEM engagement**
- Supporting **wellbeing** as foundational to learning

**Meta-Pet Supports All Four:**

1. **Student voice/agency:** Students choose goals, test strategies, own their learning pace
2. **Positive behaviour frameworks:** Routines, responsibility, repair without punishment
3. **STEM engagement:** Hands-on systems thinking with immediate feedback
4. **Wellbeing foundation:** Emotional vocabulary, self-regulation practice, calm digital environment

### The "KPPS-Made" Story

**Why this matters:**
- Built **with a KPPS student** (my son) — not imposed by external vendors
- Shaped by **KPPS values** from the ground up — not retrofitted to school language
- Offered as **partnership** — pilot together, iterate based on KPPS teacher/student feedback, refine for your specific community

**Leadership Positioning:**
- "This is a KPPS parent offering a tool made specifically for our school's culture."
- "We pilot it, evaluate it, and decide together whether it serves our students."
- "If it works, we tell the story: KPPS as innovator in values-driven edtech."

## 6. Risk Mitigation & Objection Handling

### Potential Concerns & Responses

**Concern 1:** "We don't have time for new programs."

**Response:**  
- **20 minutes × 7 sessions** = 2 hours 20 minutes total over 2 weeks
- No setup overhead (no accounts, no data exports, no parent opt-in forms)
- Fits existing STEM time or wellbeing blocks — doesn't require new schedule slots
- Teacher scripts provided — minimal prep needed

**Concern 2:** "What about students who don't have devices?"

**Response:**  
- Pair/group work built into design (Sessions 2, 4, 6)
- Can run whole-class with teacher device + projector if needed
- KPPS already has 1:1 device program (Years 3–6); this aligns with existing infrastructure

**Concern 3:** "How do we know it's safe?"

**Response:**  
- Offline-first = structurally safer than cloud-based tools
- No accounts = no data breach risk
- Open for ICT Coordinator review before pilot (developer available for technical questions)
- Privacy & Safety Brief provided in this package

**Concern 4:** "What if students don't engage?"

**Response:**  
- Pilot design includes **engagement metrics** (Session 7 debrief: thumbs up/sideways/down)
- If students disengage, that's valuable feedback — we iterate or discontinue
- Early playtesting with KPPS student showed sustained interest over weeks (but formal pilot will confirm)

**Concern 5:** "Is this just gamification?"

**Response:**  
- No points, no leaderboards, no achievements, no timers, no competition
- **Systems simulation**, not game mechanics
- Students engage because the system is **interesting** (emergent complexity), not because they're chasing rewards
- STEM curriculum calls this "modelling" — that's what this is

---

## 7. Success Metrics for Pilot Evaluation

**At Session 7, leadership can assess:**

| Metric | How to Measure | What Success Looks Like |
|---|---|---|
| **Engagement** | Student feedback (thumbs up/sideways/down); teacher observation of sustained attention | Students want to return without timers/FOMO; minimal off-task behaviour |
| **Wellbeing Language** | Student reflections (do they use state → cause → repair language?) | Students can name emotions and identify recovery strategies (not just for pet — for self) |
| **STEM Thinking** | Student explanations (Session 7 showcase: can they describe homeostasis, feedback loops, genetic variation?) | Students use systems vocabulary accurately in their own words |
| **Digital Safety Perception** | Anonymous student survey: "Did this feel safer than other apps? Why?" | Students and parents report comfort with offline-first design |
| **Teacher Workload** | Teacher debrief: "Did this add friction or reduce it?" | Teachers report minimal prep, smooth classroom management, clear alignment to existing curriculum |

**Deliverable to School Council:**
- Engagement data (% of students actively participating)
- Wellbeing language evidence (sample student reflections)
- STEM curriculum alignment confirmation (teacher testimony)
- Digital safety story (parent + student feedback)
- Recommendation: continue, refine, or discontinue

## 8. Next Steps for Leadership

**If you decide to pilot:**

1. **Choose pilot class** (one teacher, one class, 2 weeks)
2. **Send parent communication** (template provided in Package)
3. **Schedule Session 1** (20 min, teacher uses script from Facilitation Guide)
4. **Debrief at Session 7** (collect data for School Council report)

**If you want more information first:**

- **Technical walkthrough** with ICT Coordinator (I can demo architecture, privacy features)
- **Teacher Q&A session** (I can meet with interested teachers to answer questions)
- **Review student materials** (Reflection Prompts, session plans) before committing

**If you're not ready:**

- No obligation. This is offered as partnership, not vendor pressure.
- Feedback on why it doesn't fit is valuable for future refinement.

## Closing: Strategic Positioning

**KPPS has an opportunity to tell this story:**

*"We piloted a privacy-first classroom Meta-Pet built with one of our own students. It aligned with our values, supported our wellbeing framework, and made STEM thinking tangible. Whether we continue using it or not, we demonstrated that KPPS leads with student safety, thoughtful innovation, and values-driven decision-making."*

That's a School Council report.  
That's a newsletter story.  
That's a differentiator in your Annual Implementation Plan.

Built with a KPPS kid.  
Shaped by the KPPS way.  
Ready when you are.
