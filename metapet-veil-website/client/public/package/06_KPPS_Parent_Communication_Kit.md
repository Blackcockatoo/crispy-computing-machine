## Message 1: Initial Pilot Announcement
**Timing:** Before Session 1 (at least 3 days notice)  
**Subject:** New Wellbeing & STEM Pilot in [Teacher Name]'s Class

---

Dear [Class Name] Families,

We're excited to share that [Teacher Name]'s class will be piloting a new wellbeing and STEM tool over the next two weeks, starting [Date].

**What it is:**  
A privacy-first "Meta-Pet" system designed by a KPPS parent in collaboration with their child (one of our students). Students care for a digital companion that responds to their actions using systems science principles — the same ones they'll learn in biology, ecology, and human health.

**Why we're trying it:**  
This tool aligns with our KPPS values (Respect, Resilience, Excellence, Cooperation, Community) and supports our wellbeing curriculum. It's also a hands-on way to teach homeostasis, feedback loops, and data literacy — core STEM concepts.

**What makes it different:**  
Unlike most classroom apps, this one is **offline-first** with **no accounts required** and **no student data transmission**. Your child's Meta-Pet lives entirely on their device. We never see it, track it, or store any information about it. There are no timers, no notifications, and no addictive mechanics — just calm, thoughtful interaction.

**What students will do:**  
Seven 20-minute sessions exploring care routines, emotional awareness, systems thinking, and data patterns. Students will reflect on what they observe and connect it to real-life self-regulation strategies.

**How you can support:**  
If your child mentions their Meta-Pet at home, ask them: "What did you notice today?" or "What pattern are you seeing?" We'll share a summary at the end of the two weeks.

**Questions or concerns?**  
Please reach out to [Teacher Name] or [Wellbeing Coordinator]. We're happy to discuss any aspect of this pilot.

This is a trial, not a commitment. We'll evaluate whether it serves our students and decide together as a school community.

Thank you for your partnership,  
[Principal Name]

## Message 2: Mid-Pilot Check-In (Optional)
**Timing:** After Session 3 or 4  
**Subject:** Meta-Pet Pilot Update — What We're Seeing

---

Dear [Class Name] Families,

We're halfway through our Meta-Pet pilot, and we wanted to share what we're noticing.

**What students are learning:**  
Students are practising observation skills, connecting cause and effect, and using wellbeing language like "My pet feels Anxious, so I'm focusing on Rest first." They're also applying STEM concepts like homeostasis and feedback loops in real time.

**What teachers are noticing:**  
[Teacher Name] reports that students are engaged without needing timers or reward systems. The offline-first design means no login issues, no forgotten passwords, and no "it won't load" frustrations. Students can close the app without anxiety because there are no streaks or countdowns.

**What you might hear at home:**  
Your child might talk about their Meta-Pet's "mood" or mention trying different strategies to help it feel balanced. This is intentional — we're teaching systems thinking through a relatable, low-stakes simulation.

**Privacy reminder:**  
Your child's Meta-Pet data never leaves their device. No accounts, no tracking, no uploads. This is structurally safe by design.

**Next week:**  
We'll shift into the STEM lens — students will analyse patterns, test hypotheses, and present their learning. We'll share a summary when the pilot concludes.

As always, reach out with questions.

Warm regards,  
[Teacher Name]

## Message 3: Post-Pilot Summary
**Timing:** After Session 7  
**Subject:** Meta-Pet Pilot Complete — Here's What We Learned

---

Dear [Class Name] Families,

Our two-week Meta-Pet pilot has concluded, and we want to share what we discovered.

**The numbers:**  
- [X]% of students reported that the experience was valuable
- [X]% said it felt "safer" than other classroom apps
- [X]% want to continue using it (if the school decides to proceed)

**What students learned:**  
Through caring for a digital companion, students practised:
- **Wellbeing skills:** recognising emotional states, choosing recovery strategies, bouncing back from challenges
- **STEM thinking:** homeostasis, feedback loops, genetic variation, data literacy
- **KPPS values:** Respect (thoughtful interaction), Resilience (repair without blame), Excellence (goal-setting), Cooperation (peer learning), Community (shared knowledge-building)

**Teacher feedback:**  
[Teacher Name] noted that the tool **reduced classroom management friction** (no login issues, no "I forgot my password"). Students engaged deeply without needing external rewards. The session scripts made preparation straightforward.

**Student voices (anonymous samples):**  
- "I learned that if one thing is wrong, fixing just that one thing doesn't always work. You have to look at the whole system."
- "My Meta-Pet's DNA makes it different from my friend's. That's like how we're all different but follow the same rules."
- "When my pet felt Overwhelmed, I helped it rest. Now I know that's what I need when I feel overwhelmed too."

**Privacy confirmation:**  
As promised, no student data was transmitted during the pilot. The offline-first design worked exactly as described.

**What happens next:**  
School leadership will review the pilot data and decide whether to continue, refine, or discontinue this tool. Your feedback is welcome — please email [Principal/Wellbeing Coordinator] if you have thoughts to share.

**Thank you:**  
To [Teacher Name] for facilitating this trial, to students for their curiosity and thoughtful participation, and to you for supporting your child's learning.

This was a genuine experiment — KPPS trying something new, built by our own community, with our students' wellbeing and safety as the priority.

With appreciation,  
[Principal Name]

### Meta-Pet Pilot: Frequently Asked Questions

---

**Q: What is a Meta-Pet?**  
A: It's a digital companion that students care for using four vitals (Nutrition, Hydration, Rest, Stimulation). The pet responds with 15 different emotional states based on how students interact with it. It's designed to teach systems thinking (homeostasis, feedback loops) and wellbeing skills (emotional awareness, self-regulation).

---

**Q: Is this a game?**  
A: No. It's a **systems simulation** — the same kind of modelling used in science class to explore ecosystems or the human body. There are no points, no leaderboards, no achievements, and no timers. Students engage because the system is interesting, not because they're chasing rewards.

---

**Q: Why is it called "Meta-Pet"?**  
A: "Meta" means "beyond" or "about." This isn't just a pet simulation — it's a tool for thinking **about** systems, emotions, and cause-effect relationships. Students observe their own thinking as they care for the pet. That's metacognition.

---

**Q: Who built this?**  
A: A KPPS parent (who is also a developer) in collaboration with their child, a KPPS student. It was designed specifically for Kingsley Park's values and curriculum. This isn't a commercial product — it's a community-built prototype offered as partnership.

---

**Q: What data does it collect?**  
A: **None.** The Meta-Pet's "DNA" (a 180-digit genetic code) and all interaction data stay entirely on your child's device. The system is **offline-first** — it doesn't need internet to function. There are no accounts, no logins, and no data uploads. We (the school and the developer) never see what happens in your child's Meta-Pet.

---

**Q: Can other students see my child's Meta-Pet?**  
A: No. Each student's Meta-Pet is private to their device. Students might share observations in class discussions (e.g., "My pet felt Calm when I focused on Rest"), but the actual pet and its data are not visible to others.

---

**Q: Is it safe?**  
A: Yes. The offline-first architecture removes most digital risks:
- No accounts = no passwords to leak
- No data transmission = no information to breach
- No third-party trackers = no hidden data collection
- No timers or notifications = no addictive manipulation

Additionally, the UX is designed to be **calm** (meditation mechanics, gentle pacing, no dopamine exploitation). Students can close the app without anxiety.

---

**Q: Will my child's Meta-Pet "die" if they don't check it constantly?**  
A: No. This is not a Tamagotchi. Vitals pause when the app is closed. There are no countdowns, no streak systems, and no penalties for not checking in. Students engage during class time (20 minutes per session) and can ignore it outside of that without consequence.

---

**Q: What if my child finds it stressful?**  
A: Some students might feel responsible for "fixing" their pet's mood. Teachers are trained to frame this as **systems observation**, not personal failure. If a student is genuinely distressed, they can opt out of independent practice and observe classmates instead. Wellbeing is the priority — the tool should support it, not undermine it.

---

**Q: How does this fit KPPS curriculum?**  
A: It aligns with:
- **STEM:** homeostasis, feedback loops, genetic variation, data literacy
- **Wellbeing:** emotional vocabulary, self-regulation, resilience strategies
- **Explicit Teaching Model:** structured sessions using "I Do / We Do / You Do" (Gradual Release)
- **KPPS Values:** Respect, Resilience, Excellence, Cooperation, Community (see Session Plans for details)

---

**Q: Can we use this at home?**  
A: The pilot is classroom-only for now. If the school decides to continue, home use might be an option later. However, the tool is designed for **reflective, guided practice** — it works best with teacher facilitation.

---

**Q: What if KPPS decides not to continue after the pilot?**  
A: That's fine. This is a genuine trial, not a foregone conclusion. If it doesn't serve our students, we discontinue. The feedback will help the developer refine the tool for other schools or improve it for a future KPPS trial.

---

**Q: How can I give feedback?**  
A: Email [Principal Name] or [Wellbeing Coordinator] with your thoughts. Anonymous surveys may also be shared at the end of the pilot.

---

**Q: My child has additional learning needs. Will this work for them?**  
A: The tool is designed with flexibility:
- Pair/group work options (no solo requirement)
- Visual clarity (colour-coded vitals, large text)
- Calm pacing (no timers, no pressure)
- Scaffolded reflection prompts (simpler vs. more complex options)

If your child needs specific accommodations, please discuss with [Teacher Name] before the pilot begins.

---

**Q: Is this replacing anything?**  
A: No. This is a **two-week trial** that fits into existing STEM or wellbeing time. It's not replacing other programs — it's testing whether it complements them.

---

**Q: What happens to the Meta-Pet after the pilot?**  
A: If the school continues, students can keep their Meta-Pet and use it periodically. If the school discontinues, students can delete the app (or keep it for personal use — the developer is considering a non-classroom version). Either way, no data is "lost" because none was collected.

---

**Q: Who do I contact if I have concerns?**  
A: Start with [Teacher Name]. For policy or technical questions, contact [Principal Name] or [ICT Coordinator]. For privacy concerns, the developer is available for technical walkthroughs.

## Message 5: Optional — If Pilot Is Extended or Adopted
**Timing:** After leadership decides to continue  
**Subject:** Meta-Pet Pilot Continues — Next Steps

---

Dear KPPS Families,

After reviewing the pilot data, we've decided to **continue using the Meta-Pet tool** in [specific classes / year levels / school-wide].

**Why we're continuing:**  
- Student engagement was strong without requiring addictive mechanics
- Wellbeing language improved (students could articulate state → cause → repair)
- STEM concepts (homeostasis, data literacy) became tangible through hands-on practice
- Privacy design aligned with our digital safety commitments
- Teachers reported reduced classroom friction (no login issues, no compliance overhead)

**What changes based on feedback:**  
[Optional: mention any refinements — e.g., "We're adding more STEM extension prompts for advanced students" or "We're simplifying Session 2 pacing based on teacher notes."]

**What happens next:**  
- [Details: e.g., "Year 3–4 classes will use it in Term 2" or "We'll integrate it into weekly wellbeing blocks"]
- Teachers will continue using the session scripts and reflection prompts provided
- We'll revisit this decision at [timeframe — e.g., end of Term 2] and adjust as needed

**Thank you:**  
To the [Class Name] students who piloted this, to [Teacher Name] for facilitating, and to families who supported this trial. You helped KPPS lead with thoughtful innovation.

As always, reach out with questions.
